    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>
        There are two players in this game. You are one of them.
        Both of you are suspected of committing crimes.
        The judge decides to offer you two a bargain:
            Note: betray = to say that the other person committed a crime
    </p>

    <p>
        If you betray the other person, you are set free and the other person
        receives a 3 year sentence.
        If the other person betrays you, then he/she is set free and you receive
        a 3 year sentence.
        If you both betray each other, then you both serve two year sentences.
        If you both choose to remain silent, then both of you will serve only 1 year.
    </p>
